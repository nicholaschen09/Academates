# Academates üë•

## Inspiration ‚ú®
At Academates, we‚Äôve experienced the struggles of senioritis and the challenges that arise when studying in unmotivating environments. We have realized the crucial role a supportive learning environment plays in academic success. When studying at home, distractions like TikTok and Instagram dampen our productivity. However, we‚Äôve recognized that studying in a library or focused group setting can enhance motivation and productivity. That‚Äôs why we founded Academates.

## Functionality ‚öôÔ∏è
Academates is a simple online platform that connects ambitious high school students for academic support and motivation. Here's how it works:
Sign up using Google.
Select your grade level and specify your subsequent subjects.
Join a chatroom to connect with local high school students in your region to cultivate a collaborative learning environment and share your academic journey.
Dive into interactive study groups: feel free to ask questions or start a pomodoro session!
Reap the benefits of being amongst a supportive learning community.
Together, we can combat senioritis and cultivate a community that fosters motivation, productivity, and personal growth, empowering students to thrive in their academic journeys!


## How we built it üõ†Ô∏è
We began our project by designing and prototyping our website using Figma. We also bootstrapped our project using the ‚ÄúCreate React App‚Äù. We delegated our tasks among team members, which included: 
1) working on the functionality of the app
2) designing the app to create a visually appealing platform that students would be able to interact with and enjoy.

## Challenges üí™
Across the 36-hours, we ran into various challenges. One significant challenge we encountered during the development process was an issue with the Firebase authentication and its interaction with the CORS policy. When an authentication error occurred, the error component attempted to display an error message, however, due to the CORS policy restrictions, the request to fetch the error details from the Firebase API was blocked. To address this challenge, we researched the documentation for hours, only finding a solution with the aid of a mentor. Their aid was invaluable, and helped us get through a significant problem.

Using React, we were also facing problems during the app development process, including broken links, buttons, and text. This compelled us to focus on debugging and problem-solving on the go.

## Accomplishments üèÜ
The big accomplishment and goal of this hackathon is to make a working product, which was done through the seamless combination of the design and functionallity. We wanted to ensure a user-friendly interface that not only looked visually appealing but also delivered a smooth and intuitive user experience. We‚Äôre also proud of the way we overcame many bugs in the process of creating the app. Using Figma for the first time, we created a visually appealing user interface that brought out our creativity.

## What We Learned üß†
By creating a design in Figma before the end product was coded, we learned the importance of creating a website that has a responsive and functional piece, and a consistent theme that engages the user. Using firebase as our host of data, we learned about utilizing cloud-based services for seamless backend functionality.

## Next Steps ‚û°Ô∏è
Our vision is to continue expanding and refining the platform to better serve high school students and create a thriving community of learners. Here are a few key directions we are planning to explore:

Partnerships and Outreach: We will seek partnerships with educational institutions, tutors, and subject matter experts to expand our network and provide students with access to a wider range of resources and expertise. Additionally, we plan to engage in outreach programs, collaborating with schools and educational organizations to promote Academates and support students in their academic journeys.

Technological Advancements: We will also work towards implementing a function that allows for video call and voice messages so that users won't have to spent as much time on the website typing their answers and responses. We would also like to introduce a new feature where the user is automatically shown chatrooms that are filled with students that are located near the user. 

The future of Academates is focused on continuous improvement, innovation, and the pursuit of academic excellence. We are dedicated to creating an inclusive and supportive platform that empowers high school students to succeed in their studies and connect with a vibrant community of learners.
